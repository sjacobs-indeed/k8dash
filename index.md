K8dash (pronounced /kƒÅt,daSH/ or Kate Dash) is Indeed's open source Kubernetes dashboard. 

A Kubernetes dashboard allows you to quickly understand the concepts of your cluster in a visual way. You can also manage your cluster components via the dashboard. 

## K8dash Features

K8dash is an enhancement over the standard Kubernetes dashboard. 

With K8dash you can: 

* Fully manage your cluster including namespaces, nodes, pods, replica sets, deployments, storage, RBAC, and more. 
* Learn the status of components, which pods are deployed, and which pods or deployments use the most resources.
* Benefit from a real time Kubernetes dashboard that automatically refreshes and updates the browser.
* Quickly view your cluster's health, at a glance, via real time charts that help you track down poorly performing resources.
* Monitor your cluster while on-the-go via the 100% responsive UI that runs on your phone or tablet.
* Get started in as quickly as one minute using the provided YAML. Run it in the Kubernetes command-line tool (kubectl). 
* Use the API to easily update and scale your cluster, which includes inline API docs that describe each field.
* Employ a Simple Open ID integration with no special proxies required.
